  - Better error messages for malformed 3MF files
* **Build System:**
  - Updated manifest format for modern Blender addon structure (blender_manifest.toml)
  - Fixed test mock objects for Python 3.11+ compatibility

Testing
----
* **Unit Tests (142 tests, all passing):**
  - All original unit tests updated and passing (Python 3.11)
  - Mock objects updated for modern operator interface
  - Tests verify type hints don't break runtime behavior
  - Code style validation with pycodestyle
* **Integration Tests (16 tests, all passing):**
  - New integration tests verify real-world Blender functionality
  - Test simple and complex geometry export/import
  - Verify material round-trip preservation
  - Test modifier evaluation
  - Confirm selection-only export
  - Validate Blender 4.2+ API compatibility
* **Cross-Platform Test Runners:**
  - PowerShell script for Windows
  - Bash script for macOS/Linux
  - Auto-detection of Blender installations
  - Multi-version testing support
* **CI/CD:**
  - GitHub Actions automatically run all 142 unit tests
  - Python 3.11 validation
  - Code style checks
* **Real-World Testing:**
  - Tested across Blender 4.2 LTS, 4.3, 4.5, and 5.0 Alpha
  - Verified export â†’ import round-trip functionality
  - Confirmed material preservation through round-trip operations
  - Tested with complex multi-object 3MF files (50+ objects)
  - Verified warning deduplication with extension-heavy files
